# 🧠 Context Engineering Lab

> _Structured thinking, modular inputs, explainable outputs._  
> _A personal lab for designing and evaluating context-aware workflows for LLM systems._

## 📌 What is this?

**Context Engineering Lab** is a structured collection of design experiments around:

- 🧱 Structured Input Design (e.g. multi-modal prompt templates)
- 🔍 Vector Search & Retrieval (e.g. semantic chunking, FAISS)
- 🧠 LLM Integration (e.g. reasoning tasks, RAG pipelines)
- 📊 Prompt Evaluation (human-in-the-loop + automated metrics)

Each module explores a different angle of making LLMs **more grounded, interpretable, and production-ready**, especially in **security, behavior modeling**, and **explainability-critical** settings.

## 🧪 Modules

| Module | Title | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| 01 | Context Graph Construction | ✅ published |
| 02 | Retrieval-Enhanced Prompting | ✅ draft complete |
| 03 | Structured Input & ATO Evaluation | ✅ published |
| 04 | Agent Routing via Structured Context | 🧭 planned |

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Explore **prompt architecture** from a systems + design perspective
- Apply **consulting-style reasoning (CCE: Complete, Conclusive, Explainable)** to LLM workflows
- Build and test patterns that improve grounding, control, and downstream integration

---

## 🚫 Not included

This lab does **not** focus on:
- Fine-tuning LLMs
- Proprietary tooling or closed-source platforms
- General prompt tips — this is about structured, testable input design

---

## 🗂️ Usage & Navigation

Each module includes:
- ✅ Markdown design doc (in `/modules`)
- 📓 Optional notebooks (in `/notebooks`)
- 🧪 Prompt templates + sample outputs (in `/examples`)
- 📊 Evaluation plans or logging scripts (in `/eval`)
